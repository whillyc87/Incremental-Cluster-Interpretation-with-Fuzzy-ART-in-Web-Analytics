HIS 2022 Paper Title: ** Incremental Cluster Interpretation with Fuzzy ART in Web Analytics **
List of Authors: Chang Wui Lee, Sing Ling Ong, Jill Ling

It consists of an excel data file for the collection of training data, the Fuzzy ART clustering algorithm, the basic algorithm of Evolving Vector Quantization, the K-Means algorithm, and their respective application code files that are constructed in MATLAB coding.

Download the files in a single directory in MATLAB environment.
Execute FuzzyART_WebAnalytics.m to obtain the clustering results using Fuzzy ART algorithm.
Execute KMean_WebAnalytics.m to obtain the clustering results using K-Means algorithm.
Execute EVQ_WebAnalytics.m to obtain the clustering results using Evolving Vector Quantization algorithm.
